MediTrack+ is an innovative project poised to revolutionize medical inventory 
management through the seamless integration of cutting-edge technologies. 
Harnessing the power of React for the frontend and Django for the backend, this 
system provides a user-friendly interface accessible across various devices, ensuring 
easy navigation and interaction for healthcare staff. At its core, MediTrack+ 
leverages Firebase Realtime Database for instantaneous data synchronization, 
guaranteeing that all users have access to the latest inventory information in real
time. Additionally, Firebase Cloud Storage offers a secure platform for storing 
critical documents and files related to medical inventory, ensuring compliance and 
easy access when needed. 
 
The backbone of MediTrack+ lies in its utilization of ESP32 microcontrollers 
equipped with RFID technology for precise asset tracking. By attaching RFID tags 
to medical supplies, the system enables accurate monitoring of inventory levels and 
locations, significantly reducing manual errors and streamlining inventory 
management processes. From storage rooms to patient wards, MediTrack+ ensures 
that healthcare facilities have full visibility into their inventory, minimizing 
stockouts and optimizing supply chain efficiency. 
 
With MediTrack+, healthcare providers can streamline operations, enhance 
productivity, and ultimately improve patient care by ensuring the availability of 
essential supplies when and where they are needed most. This comprehensive 
solution represents a significant step forward in medical inventory management, 
promising to revolutionize the way healthcare facilities track, monitor, and manage 
their resources.
